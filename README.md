# My Experimental Projects

These are small, experimental projects I uploaded to GitHub to practice coding and stay active.  
There’s no big plan behind them—just some fun exercises and tests.  

## About
- Mostly basic scripts, demos, or small projects.  
- They are not polished or meant for production.  

## Projects Included
- Simple css and html projects 
- Small JavaScript exercises  
- Fun little experiments  

## Note
These projects are mainly for learning and testing purposes.  
Feel free to look around, but don’t expect anything serious 
I will also share my mini python projects in the next time :)
